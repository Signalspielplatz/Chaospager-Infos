<H3>Recap of 39c3</H3>

During our talk at 39c3, we had the great honor to announce — in Hall 1, to put the cherry on the cake  — we're currently the very first project to run and test <b><i>DAPNET Core 2.0 Alpha</b></i>! This means we'll be able to connect to <i>THOT</i> (the management software CERT uses) via REST API, as well as a free hand to use our current solution for all necessary purposes due to the MIT license (instead of being limited to experiments conducted within amateur radio guidelines). 

[Our talk at 39c3](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-chaospager-how-to-construct-an-open-pager-system-for-c3) (Dapnet announcement and list of details starts shortly after minute 22)

Our time at the congress was structured around the following research questions:
- RQ1: Are the POCSAG transmitters able to cover the congress area?

-> A: Currently yes for empty bulding, but not when all the assemblies and visitors are inside; we'll need one or two additonal transmitters (planned: one on the roof)
- RQ2: Can <i>Dapnet 2.0 Alpha core </i> orchestrate a small sized transmitter network?
 
-> A: Yes!
- RQ3: What is the alignment of the reception sensitivity beween values measures in the lab and the real world?
 
-> A: no conclusive answer yet?

Overall, we had an overwhelmingly positive response to our project and received many visitors at our assembly who wanted to discuss technical aspects or just have a look at our hardware :) 

In addition, there still was time for a few side quests like sticker distribution and the spontaneous appearance of the infamous "Rotary Phone from Hell" on the evening of day 1, which got connected to the congress phone network via an oldschool wire and drew lots of attention (of varying quality) due to its truly hellish bell noise.

And thanks to one of the neighboring assemblies, we had easy access to Mate slushy to keep us caffeinated (in addition to our own coffee machine). Cotton candy might or might not have been involved in the fuelling of our endeavors.


<H3>Norddeutscher Funktag</H3>
For the second time now, we set up our assembly at Norddeutscher Funktag, which takes places in Hamburg as well, namely at the Hamburg University of Techology (TUHH). This year, it happened just a few days after 39c3, on the 3rd of January. For the first time, a few talks at this event were recorded, and we'll add here the link to our talk (in German) as soon as it's out.
